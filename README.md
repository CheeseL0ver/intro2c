# Introduction to C

This repository is the workshop materials for the Linux@App Introduction to C workshops.

Each workshop meeting has its own subdirectory with the materials for that meeting. Each
subdirectory contains a README.md like this one with instructions for using the materials.

Hopefully, the materials are sufficiently verbose that you can read through them to get the
same content as attending a workshop.

Pull requests and suggestions welcome!
